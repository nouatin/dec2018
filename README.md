All photos took in that connexion can appear on my mobile phone.
Another side of the project is to ...    With Pir sensor connected to the PI, i measure and save my work-time on local data-base mongodb.
My target by doing this is to visualize my work duration at home per week, per month and per year. 
Another side of the project is to take a photo of my home entrance room from my smartphone and see them.
