one device based on ESP8266 send outside and inside temperature with inside l'humidity  (took with DS18B20 and DHT11) 
to nodejs server running on raspberry-pi by MQTT. Web client connect to the serveur display differents values by graphic.
With One button in the interface, we can change light state. 
With Pir sensor connected to the PI, i measure and save my work-time on local data-base mongodb.
My target by doing this is to visualize my work duration at home per week, per month and per year. 
Another side of the project is to take a photo of my home entrance room from my smartphone and see them. At this time, i have not finished with that side of the project
